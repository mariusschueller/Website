        <h2>Hi there!</h2>
        <img src="images/selfie.jpg">
        <h2 class="section">A little about me</h2>
        <p>My name is Marius Schueller, I'm 20 years old, and I'm a Junior at Vanderbilt University. 
            I'm a Computer Science major with minors in Digital Fabrication and Data Science.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section">Computer Science</h2>
        <p>I first learned how to code when I was 15 years old (not counting previous brief introductions). 
            I started by learning how to make games in Unity in C#. 
            Since then, I've learned Python, C++, Java, HTML, CSS, and more.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section">Music</h2>
        <p>I started learning piano at 5 years old. Then, when I was 8, I began playing cello. 
            I have also learned how to play new instruments including guitar, kalimba, and melodica.
            I now enjoy making <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mariusmakesmusic/" class="link">videos</a> where I play these instruments.</p>

        <h2 class="section">Teaching</h2>
        <p>I started teaching at 16 years old as a private piano teacher.
            I specialize in teaching younger learners, but I welcome learners of any age. 
            In 2022, I began tutoring as an online computer science tutor on Wyzant. 
            If you're interested in me as a tutor, don't hesitate to <a href="contact.html" class="link">reach out</a> to me personally.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section">Other Interests</h2>
        <p>Believe it or not, I don't spend all my time do the things above.
            I also love to play Ultimate Frisbee and captain Vanderbilt's Ultimate Frisbee team.
            In addition, I love to go climbing (indoors). I mostly do top rope, but I'll boulder upon ocassion.
            Another activity I love to do is Ballet. I practice and perform with Vanderbilt Ballet Theater.
            Overall, I just like to learn new things and try to do whatever interests me.
