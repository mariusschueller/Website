            I’m pretty happy with my results this week up until the weekend. I think for weekends when I have ultimate frisbee tournaments, it’s gonna be extremely difficult to keep the habit going because those take up my mornings, and in the afternoons, I’m usually exhausted from physical activity all day. But I want to get back into the habit and move forward after the weekend.

            Overall: <br>
            Awesome week for learning! I’m pivoting slightly to focus more on learning for projects. This has worked really well to help me stay motivated for my habit, but also to make progress on my projects, which has been pretty sporadic generally. The place I’d like to improve is definitely the exercise aspect and push myself more consistently. Also, my next week is gonna be busier, so I’d like to keep up the good work.

            Overall: <br>
            This week was not great. I’m happy about the consistent exercise, but I need to do better otherwise. I’m going to start setting alarms so that I have enough time in the morning. I normally don’t like alarms, and prefer that I wake up naturally, but I’m running out of time.

            Week of 9/15/25: A Tough Beginning

            <br><br>Monday:<br>
            I made a login password page based on a challenge on icodethis.com.

          <div style="display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; flex-wrap: wrap;">

            Mine: <img src="9.15/9.15.png" style="margin: auto; width: 40%;">

            Ex: <img src="9.15/9.15.other.png" style="margin: auto; width: 40%;">

          Here's my code: <a href="https://github.com/mariusschueller/Marius-Mornings/tree/main/morning_challenges/9.15"

          <br><br>
          I also went on a 10 minute walk.

          <br><br>Tuesday:<br>
          Today I made an origami sea turtle.
          <br><img src="9.15/9.15turtle.jpeg" style="margin: auto; width: 40%;"><br><br>
          
          I went on a 3 mile run as well.

          <br><br>Wednesday:<br>
          Today I had a late wakeup but drew a few flowers, 
          but you better believe I went on another walk.
          <br><img src="9.15/9.15drawing.jpeg" class="images">

          <br><br>Thursday:<br>
          Today was similar to Wednesday but no activity, but at least I got a walk in.

          <br><br>Friday:<br>
          Today I coded a rating visualization for <a href="https://apancakelover.com" target="_blank">my pancake site</a>. 
          Pretty happy with the results and perfectly visualizes my rating system.

          Unfortunately, I was travelling all day so I wan't able to exercise because I was travelling all day.

          <br><br>Saturday:<br>
          I wasn't able to practice a new skill because I played in an ultimate frisbee 
          tournament most of the day, and spent the rest hanging out with the team.

          <br><br>Sunday:<br>
          Today I updated this page and planned out the next week of activities. 
          For exercise, today was day 2 of the ultimate frisbee tournament.
          
          <br><br>

          For next week: I'm happy that I was able to a few days and I want to build off of that.
          My focus is on being able to consistently accomplish my daily habit. 
          I plan to set an alarm that'll give me enough time in the morning.
