            This week I was quite busy. I was mostly okay but traveling to 4 different cities made it tough. The biggest thing I can do to help is to go to bed early so that I’m available in the morning. I also think that I’ll make a lot more progress once I can build my mobile project, which I’m confident I’ll be able to do early next week.

            I struggled this week because I didn’t have a project I could really work on. That is gonna change, as I want to really focus on learning mobile app development. Right now, I know I can make one, but I want to be more confident in my abilities. My main task is gonna be breaking tasks down into 30 minute learning chunks.

            I’m pretty happy with my results this week up until the weekend. I think for weekends when I have ultimate frisbee tournaments, it’s gonna be extremely difficult to keep the habit going because those take up my mornings, and in the afternoons, I’m usually exhausted from physical activity all day. But I want to get back into the habit and move forward after the weekend.

            Awesome week for learning! I’m pivoting slightly to focus more on learning for projects. This has worked really well to help me stay motivated for my habit, but also to make progress on my projects, which has been pretty sporadic generally. The place I’d like to improve is definitely the exercise aspect and push myself more consistently. Also, my next week is gonna be busier, so I’d like to keep up the good work.

            I made a login password page based on a challenge on icodethis.com.

          I also went on a 10 minute walk.

          <br><br>Tuesday:<br>
          Today I made an origami sea turtle.

          I went on a 3 mile run as well.

          <br><br>Wednesday:<br>
          Today I had a late wakeup but drew a few flowers, 
          but you better believe I went on another walk.

          <br><br>Thursday:<br>
          Today was similar to Wednesday but no activity, but at least I got a walk in.

          <br><br>Friday:<br>
          Today I coded a rating visualization for <a href="https://apancakelover.com" target="_blank">my pancake site</a>. 
          Pretty happy with the results and perfectly visualizes my rating system.

          Unfortunately, I was travelling all day so I wan't able to exercise because I was travelling all day.

          <br><br>Saturday:<br>
          I wasn't able to practice a new skill because I played in an ultimate frisbee 
          tournament most of the day, and spent the rest hanging out with the team.

          <br><br>Sunday:<br>
          Today I updated this page and planned out the next week of activities. 
          For exercise, today was day 2 of the ultimate frisbee tournament.
          
          <br><br>

          For next week: I'm happy that I was able to a few days and I want to build off of that.
          My focus is on being able to consistently accomplish my daily habit. 
          I plan to set an alarm that'll give me enough time in the morning.
