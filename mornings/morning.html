            Overall: <br>
            This week was not great. I’m happy about the consistent exercise, but I need to do better otherwise. I’m going to start setting alarms so that I have enough time in the morning. I normally don’t like alarms, and prefer that I wake up naturally, but I’m running out of time.

            Week of 9/15/25: A Tough Beginning

            <br><br>Monday:<br>
            I made a login password page based on a challenge on icodethis.com.

          <div style="display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; flex-wrap: wrap;">

            Mine: <img src="9.15/9.15.png" style="margin: auto; width: 40%;">

            Ex: <img src="9.15/9.15.other.png" style="margin: auto; width: 40%;">
          </div>
          Here's my code: <a href="https://github.com/mariusschueller/Marius-Mornings/tree/main/morning_challenges/9.15"

          <br><br>
          I also went on a 10 minute walk.

          <br><br>Tuesday:<br>
          Today I made an origami sea turtle.
          <br><img src="9.15/9.15turtle.jpeg" style="margin: auto; width: 40%;"><br><br>
          
          I went on a 3 mile run as well.

          <br><br>Wednesday:<br>
          Today I had a late wakeup but drew a few flowers, 
          but you better believe I went on another walk.
          <br><img src="9.15/9.15drawing.jpeg" class="images">

          <br><br>Thursday:<br>
          Today was similar to Wednesday but no activity, but at least I got a walk in.

          <br><br>Friday:<br>
          Today I coded a rating visualization for <a href="https://apancakelover.com" target="_blank">my pancake site</a>. 
          Pretty happy with the results and perfectly visualizes my rating system.

          Unfortunately, I was travelling all day so I wan't able to exercise because I was travelling all day.

          <br><br>Saturday:<br>
          I wasn't able to practice a new skill because I played in an ultimate frisbee 
          tournament most of the day, and spent the rest hanging out with the team.

          <br><br>Sunday:<br>
          Today I updated this page and planned out the next week of activities. 
          For exercise, today was day 2 of the ultimate frisbee tournament.
          
          <br><br>

          For next week: I'm happy that I was able to a few days and I want to build off of that.
          My focus is on being able to consistently accomplish my daily habit. 
          I plan to set an alarm that'll give me enough time in the morning.
