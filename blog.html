          <p>Tis the season! My family doesn't do lists for gifts, and I find it very hard to buy great gifts for other people. As a result, for the past few years, I've been making DIY gifts. This year, creating my gifts was fun, and I ended up with some cool projects, but I ran into many issues.

          <p>This week, I learned to juggle. Yeah, kind of random, but I decided it was something I wanted to do.
              So, on Sunday night, I started trying to learn. 
              I think I watched 1 video a week ago and then forgot almost all of it. 
              Regardless, I just started practicing and got the hang of it after like an hour. 
              After a little more practice, I'm more consistent and would say I've learned the skill pretty well...</p>

            I've been wanting to make a website for a while and last weekend I decided to dive right in and do it. 
            So, over the course of 3 days, I designed this website which I hope to continue updating. 
            It was made with only HTML and CSS. I designed the home, projects, about, contact, and blog pages...</p>
