                   So, on Sunday night, I started trying to learn. 
                   I think I watched 1 video a week ago and then forgot almost all of it. 
                   Regardless, I just started practicing and got the hang of it after like an hour. 
                   After a little more practice, I'm more consistent and would say I've learned the skill pretty well...</p>

                    I've been wanting to make a website for a while and last weekend I decided to dive right in and do it. 
                    So, over the course of 3 days, I designed this website which I hope to continue updating.
