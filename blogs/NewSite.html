            I believe having your own website is amazing because it gives you a public place to show your work and doubles as a form of expressing yourself. At this point, I’ve had my website for about 1.5 years, and I’ve never regretted it. I liked my original design, but it had a very traditional layout, and I’ve always been trying to make the site more creative while also reflecting my technical skills. After bouncing around a couple of ideas, I settled on making the website in the style of a pixel art platformer game.

            The homepage is now completely redesigned. In the new site, you can use the arrow keys or wasd to move to different sections. I’ve also added buttons that expand when hovered, which feels very modern. The previous website was basically only HTML and CSS, but now I’ve fully embraced the amazingness of JavaScript. 
          </p>

          <p>
            I have more plans to make it more like a platformer by actually adding platforms and allowing the player to fall into the void. I also want to improve the workflow in the blog and project pages to allow you to view other blogs and project pages more easily. Besides that, I’m open to ideas on how to make the site better.
