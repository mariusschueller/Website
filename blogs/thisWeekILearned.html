                    This week, I learned to juggle. Yeah, kind of random, but I decided it was something I wanted to do. So, on Sunday night, I started trying to learn. I think I watched 1 video a week ago and then forgot almost all of it. Regardless, I just started practicing and got the hang of it after like an hour. After a little more practice, I'm more consistent and would say I've learned the skill pretty well.

                    <p>
                        There are a few things I want to touch on in this post. First, let's talk about the website. It's changed a good amount since I made my first blog post. I've changed the project's page to have different dividers and added many projects. I've started experimenting with embedding stuff, so maybe I'll continue with that. I also changed the About page. I like the style of it way more, and the organization allows me to write more stuff about who I am.

                    <p>
                        The next thing I wanna write about is learning new things. I'm the kind of person that's always looking for things to do. I bought juggling balls maybe in October, but I never tried to learn. I think it's pretty typical to have stuff you want to learn but don't for whatever reason. In my opinion, the main issue is having a push to learn. In the case of juggling, I didn't need a strong push to get started in the case of juggling, I was simply very bored and figured I'd give it a try.
                    </p>

                    <p>I think it's important to continue to learn throughout your life. Almost every project I tackle has something new I've never done before. It's just that when it comes to projects, life tends to get in the way. In addition, finding time to get started and also to find things you want to do is challenging. To tackle the second problem, I write everything down in Google Keep (a notes app/website), so I have a huge array of possible projects. This blog post was actually originally written in Google Keep. I've used this app since I was 13, and my life would be drastically different without it. Thousands of notes (and I do mean thousands) have been written down in the 7 years since. I likely wouldn't have learned to code, made most of my projects, and overall store all of my many thoughts. So, if you don't have a place (or use a place) to write stuff down, change that, and you'll see a huge difference.</p>
                    
                    <p>Sorry for this post being disorganized and probably poorly written, but this personal blog serves as a place to collect my thoughts and put whatever I want. I've never been a fantastic writer, but the hope is that I'll get better.</p>
