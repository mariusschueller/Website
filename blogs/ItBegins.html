                  So, on Sunday night, I started trying to learn.
                  I think I watched 1 video a week ago and then forgot almost all of it.
                  Regardless, I just started practicing and got the hang of it after like an hour.
                  After a little more practice, I'm more consistent and would say I've learned the skill pretty well...

            I've been wanting to make a website for a while and last weekend I decided to dive right in and do it.

            It was made with only HTML and CSS. I designed the home, projects, about, contact, and blog pages.
          </p>

          <p>
            To create this website, I relied on three main sites.
            These were FreeFrontend, Codepen, and ChatGPT.
            FreeFrontend is a great resource for finding CSS examples.
            These examples I found on FreeFrontend would then link to Codepen where I could look at the code.
            If I had any questions about the code or anything I wanted to change but wasn't sure how to, I'd then go to
            ChatGPT.
            Between these resources and my own knowledge and problem-solving I was able to figure stuff out.
            In particular, the sites I used helped me a lot with the project and blog pages.
          </p>

          <p>
            The most challenging part of this project is by far was responsiveness. Allowing this site to work with a
            variety of screen sizes isn't necesarily intuitive and as someone new to CSS, it was a lot of playing around
            until things would look nice.
          </p>

          <p>This was a fun project. I learned a lot about website development. This site does not use javascript. Maybe
            I'll learn it and add to this website in the future, but for now I'm gonna take a well earned break from
            website development and work on some other projects.</p>
