                    I made a website to share all of my projects! 
                    By creating this website, you're able to read the words you're reading right now. 
                    I've been wanting to make a website for a while and last weekend I decided to dive right in and do it. 
                    So, over the course of 3 days, I designed this website which I hope to continue updating. 
                    It was made with only HTML and CSS. I designed the home, projects, about, contact, and blog pages.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To create this website, I relied on three main sites. 
                        These were FreeFrontend, Codepen, and ChatGPT. 
                        FreeFrontend is a great resource for finding CSS examples. 
                        These examples I found on FreeFrontend would then link to Codepen where I could look at the code. 
                        If I had any questions about the code or anything I wanted to change but wasn't sure how to, I'd then go to ChatGPT. 
                        Between these resources and my own knowledge and problem-solving I was able to figure stuff out. 
                        In particular, the sites I used helped me a lot with the project and blog pages.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        The most challenging part of this project is by far was responsiveness. Allowing this site to work with a variety of screen sizes isn't necesarily intuitive and as someone new to CSS, it was a lot of playing around until things would look nice. 
                    </p>

                    <p>This was a fun project. I learned a lot about website development. This site does not use javascript. Maybe I'll learn it and add to this website in the future, but for now I'm gonna take a well earned break from website development and work on some other projects.</p>
