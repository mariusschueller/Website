                        2025 is in the books, and to look forward, I think it’s important to look back. It’s been a wild
                        year, with its ups and few downs, the future looks bright.
                        <br><br>
                    <h3>School and Travels</h3>
                    I’ve already written a blog post on post gradution, and with more time to reflect, a lot has
                    changed. My friends have decided to pretty much spread out as much as possible. But during the fall,
                    I was able to travel across the country and visit. I went to Miami, Chicago, Boston, and New York
                    City!
                    <br><br>
                    <h3>Work</h3>
                    I love my job! I’ve started my company, <a href="https://maryson.dev" target="_blank">Maryson Developments</a>, and I have a client. I’ve been working
                    in the embedded systems and avionics space. More updates on that to come. But overall, I’m very
                    proud of what I’ve accomplished, and I can’t wait to share more next year. I’m still tutoring my
                    students, which always amazes me what they’re able to accomplish.

                    <br><br>
                    <h3>Pancakes</h3>
                    I started my <a href="https://apancakelover.com" target="_blank">pancake influencer</a> life, and it’s been fun. I think I’ve gotten better at editing,
                    which has always been something I’ve wanted to do. Hopefully, I can grow it over the next year. I’m
                    hoping I can expand more into baking pancakes. I really enjoy trying and creating new recipes, and
                    I’ll be travelling less, which will make that easier.
                    
                    <br><br>
                    <h3>Music</h3>
                    I’ve unfortunately taken a slight step back when it comes to music. It’s been busy, and I haven’t
                    prioritized music as much as I have in the past. I’ve still played and practiced a lot, but I would
                    love to get back to creating music videos as I did in the past. Hopefully, I can get back into it.
                    
                    <br><br>
                    <h3>Side Projects</h3>
                    Over the past year, I’ve started quite a few side projects. From Cold Recruit to app development
                    (hopefully publishing the app next year), and much more. Looking forward, I have plans for many side
                    projects and more. I’ve bought a very nice 3D printer and also a laser cutter. I’ve been designing
                    and experimenting a ton, and next year y’all can see what I’ve been working on.

                    <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
                    Anyways, this year was awesome. Looking forward to next year, I wonder how things will change.
