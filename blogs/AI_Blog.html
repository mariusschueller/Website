            AI is the biggest and newest development at the moment. As a programmer, AI has been predicted to “take my job,” so here is how I believe AI is impacting me now and in the future.
          </p>

          <p>
            While there are many questions related to AI including environmental impact, one of the biggest topicsI can speak on is AI’s impact on learning. In my experience as a tutor with seven years of experience, one of the best ways that people learn is by trying something, getting it wrong, and then trying again. People remember better after learning from their mistakes. But when we add AI into the equation; suddenly, I see programmers plopping an AI response into their code and running it. Especially for people learning to code, this is bad because it limits the amount of thinking needed to get things to work, which limits the amount of learning that can be done. 
          </p>

          <p>
            I do believe that AI is very good at solving problems. In my work, I’ve run into countless moments where I see a bug I’ve never seen before, and I’m able to solve it using AI. AI does a great job at diagnosing errors and telling me why they occur and an okay job at solving them. Sometimes, I need to step in and solve the problem while ignoring the AI’s incorrect response, but using AI is often the best way towards solving the problem. Before, programmers performed long and turbulous internet searches where a solution is buried on something like page 3 of Google (man I miss those days). Before it was common to say that the best programmers were the ones who could Google the best, now I would say it’s the people who can use AI the best.
          </p>

          <p>
            So, will AI take my job? Maybe, but in my opinion, I believe that new jobs will be created. I think people will be able to create more things leading to more opportunities as companies explore areas they couldn’t in the past. But obviously nobody knows for sure, so we’ll just have to wait and see.
