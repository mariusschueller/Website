            So, I just graduated from Vanderbilt and am now living in the “real world.” I spent a lot of time applying to jobs over the past year, and I can confidently conclude that the new grad cs job market is pretty messed up. The way I see things, computer science is one of the most popular majors around the country. Each year, there are hundreds of thousands more of us vying for jobs. However, there aren’t magically more jobs to fill the void. This comes with the added effect that each job receives a large number of applicants, making it hard to process each individual applicant. 

          <p>
            My response to the job market is to continue to learn. A cs college degree is only a base qualification if a ton of people have it. So, I need to do more to stand out by continuing to learn and building my network and portfolio. I genuinely love coding, so this path isn’t an issue for me. Over the past few months, I’ve continued building my web dev skills, experimented with embedded systems and raspberry pi, and recently started on an app development project.

            Now the real update is that I am fortunate enough to say I have a job that is earning me money at the moment. I’ve started my own company called Maryson Developments, and I’m doing contract work as a developer. I’m super fortunate and absolutely love my job at the moment. It’s fully remote and has flexible hours, which allows me to travel while still working. The plan moving forward is to continue to do contract work, develop some SaaS products, and continue learning on my own.
