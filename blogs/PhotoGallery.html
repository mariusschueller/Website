            It’s my 1 year anniversary with my girlfriend, and I wanted to gift her a cool present. After some thought, I decided to create a 3d photo gallery of us for her to view online. It basically serves as a cool digital scrapbook. Here’s how I made it.
          </p>

          <video autoplay loop controls style="width: 50%; display: flex; margin: auto; margin-top: 10px;">
            <source src="/videos/PhotoGallery.webm" type="video/webm">

          <h2>Basic Steps</h2>

          <p>
            Note: if you aren’t familiar with Unity and want to do this project, I’d recommend using your favorite AI to help in conjunction with this guide. I used Unity’s WebGL capabilities.
            <br>

            <br>
            - I started by moving all the photos I wanted into the Unity project I created. Next, I dragged all my photos into my scene.<br> <br>
            - After that, I set all the z values of my photos to be further and further away in my scene. <br><br>
            - I wrote a simple script to place them, but for some reason Unity was skipping values (must be a Unity bug), so instead I manually moved my GameObjects to the right places. Then, I wrote and gave all my image GameObjects this script:<br><br>
          </p>
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/mariusschueller/ab918fc69162106becfd84d58a4cf248.js"></script>
          <p>
            I had to play around with the values. But the numbers I used are what worked for me and my amount of photos. <br><br>
            - Lastly, I tested it by hitting play and then building the project.
          </p>

          <p>
            From there I deployed my Unity web project onto a subdomain, but it can also be deployed to github pages as I’ve done <a href="https://mariusschueller.github.io/Photo-Gallery/" target="_blank">here</a>. I disabled the compression method in the publishing settings to get things to work immediately. To run this website locally, you can type <span style="background-color: #f4f4f4; padding: 2px 5px; border-radius: 4px; color: #e83e8c;">python3 -m http.server</span>. If you are so inclined, you can mess with the built files if you don’t like the automatically generated Unity UI to change how things look. 
          </p>
          <h2>End</h2>
          <p>
          Anyways, this was a fun and chill project, and my girlfriend was super happy with the results. You can find the full code <a target="_blank" href="https://ko-fi.com/s/ccb05c3df8">here</a>!
