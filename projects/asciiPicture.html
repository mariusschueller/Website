                    I've been looking at the same default profile picture on GitHub for the last few years with increasing annoyance. I'm a big fan of self-expression and not having a GitHub profile picture has just felt wrong. I've always really liked Ascii art, and the idea of making my profile picture with Ascii art just popped into my head. So, I figured I'd write a program to create my profile picture.

                    <br><br>
                    I started by looking up image to Ascii python code on Google and based my code off of <a target="_blank" href='https://www.askpython.com/python/examples/turn-images-to-ascii-art-using-python'>this</a> article. From there, it was just a matter of tweaking values to get my intended result. I decided to feed it an old logo I made of my initials (which I use as the tab icon for my website), and used the text as my image. 
                    
                    <br><br>
                    Here's my final code:
                    <br>
                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/mariusschueller/e3924452bf5e46207993c5d446056b72.js"></script>
                    <br>
                    It's a pretty simple program, but fun in that I changed the characters in the code and the amount of characters represented. However, I didn't run the code with an image with much color range so it was mostly just two letters, but the effect still persists enough to the point where I'm happy.
