                    <p class="card__text">I took a project class, and for our final project, my group made an AI that predicts what year text was written, and a website to showcase it. In the final website, you are given a sentence from a book and asked to guess what year it was written. After hitting enter, the website shows what year the book was written and the AIâ€™s guess, allowing users to compare how they did against the AI.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card__text">In the project, I worked on getting all the books, sourced from project gutenberg; collecting the metadata including year written, from OpenLibrary and Google Search; and building the website that connects to an API to get out results. Our AI was quite good, and it was fun seeing people compete against our AI in the final showcase.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card__text">In this project, I learned about my deep love for web scraping. I thoroughly enjoyed sourcing the metadata and all of the issues that went along with it (and there were many). My group was also very good in this project, which allowed us to do a very equitable and manageable amount of work.
