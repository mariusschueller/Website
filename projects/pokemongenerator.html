                        It takes in the type(s) of pokemon and gives that type(s) weaknesses and resistances. 
                        I made this project because I always forget the strengths and weaknesses of each type in addition to sometimes forgetting how they all combine with each other.
                        I had a fun time with this project, and it wasn't a particularly difficult project to make.
                        My solution for getting the strength and weakness calculations with array addition felt clever, and has the added benefit of being able to combine as many types as you want.
                        I tried to use as little chatGPT as possible in this project, I only used it for creating new HTML objects in JavaScript.
