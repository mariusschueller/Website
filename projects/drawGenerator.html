                    <p class="card__text">A python program that prompts the user on whether they want to draw a pokemon, animal, or superhero. 
                        From there, the program gives a random thing from that catagory.
                        Then, the user is prompted on if they want to see a drawing tutorial for their thing pulled up in their browser.
                        The user can continue getting things from their catagory or switch to another catagory.

                        This program was created because I wanted to learn how to draw but I didn't know what to do.
                        So, I figured it would be fun to learn by drawing random pokemon. 
                        After creating the program with pokemon, I extended it to also include superheros and animals.
