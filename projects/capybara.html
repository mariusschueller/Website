                    <p class="card__text">This program beats the game of capybara clicker. This was unexpectedly one of the most frustrating projects that I've taken on. I found debugging this program to be pure pain. Maybe it was the different style of programming where I'm just controlling my mouse or the lack of sleep I had the night before, but man things were annoying to get right. I also wanted to complete the project in one day, so that was also challenging. I started at around 3pm and finished at 1am.
