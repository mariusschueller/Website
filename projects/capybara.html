                    <p class="card__text">This program beats the game of capybara clicker. Winning in this case means buying the last upgrade in the game. This was unexpectedly one of the most frustrating projects that I've taken on. I found debugging this program to be pure pain. Maybe it was the different style of programming where I'm just controlling my mouse or the lack of sleep I had the night before, but man things were annoying to get right. I also wanted to complete the project in one day, so that was also challenging. I started at around 3pm and finished at 1am.

                    <p class="card__text">The following video shows the program working. I had to refresh the website and rerun the program a few times due to lag to get a full run through.
