            <p class="card__text">I recently got a framework laptop. It's pretty cool and is what I'm writing this text
              on right now. Getting back on topic, I've generally done absolutely nothing when it comes to customizing
              and individualizing the outside of my laptops in the past. I've seen the ads in the past for computer
              skins, and with the new computer, I want to give it a try.
            </p>
            <p class="card__text">I started with the idea of using the gear logo as a way of separating different parts
              of my life. After some brainstorming, I wanted to use ballet, outdoors, programming, frisbee, engineering,
              and music as my different categories. I did trial and error to create my background colors. From there, I
              went to town in Adobe Illustrator. I based everything off of previous designs and online images. I wanted
              it to work as both my desktop background and laptop skin, so I made it work for two different form
              factors. The difference between the two forms is that 1 is extended to show branches at the end of each
              category, a metaphor illustrating how my path in those categories is still ongoing.
            </p>
            <p class="card__text">Looking at the skin on my computer, it's pretty cool. I've gotten quite a few
              compliments on the design. I also wasn't expecting people to try to guess what everything is, and in the
              process, people get to know me. Pretty fun to see it so well received.
