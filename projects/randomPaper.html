              I want to encourage myself to read more computer science papers and learn more about the research in the
              area. I figure making a program that will choose a random paper for me to read might help me learn. The
              idea is that in the morning I can read as apart of my morning routine.

              <br><br>
              I looked into a couple places. Papers We Love seemed pretty good, but not updated frequently. The next
              place I found was Papers with Code. I liked being able to look at code if I wanted to. I experimented with
              their API, but I like more the format of their paper with code dataset.

              <br><br>
              As it is, this is pretty lame. I want to try to extend it to put it on a website, but I've had a few
              issues, and I think there might be some better ways of approaching this as it seems we scraping isn't a
              good solution. Regardless, the python program works perfectly well.
