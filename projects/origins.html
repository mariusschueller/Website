                        Fair warning, this was made when I was 16, over the course of about 5 days, 
                        and I had no idea what I was doing. So, I would decribe some of these songs as very "raw". 
                        Reguardless, there are a few songs songs I'm more proud of. These are Polylight, Neon Pulse, and Nightwalk.
