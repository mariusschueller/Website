              I made this because I love to play piano to music from my phone. As someone who loves to play by ear, I
              learn a lot of songs by just playing a song on my phone and trying to play along on my keyboard. In the
              past, I've had to awkwardly put the phone on my lap or on the keyboard, where it tends to fall off.
              <br><br>So, noticing that there are two places to slot what should be a music rack to hold music, and
              given that I basically never read sheet music, I decided to use one of those holes and 3d print a stand. I
              measured the hole and my phone with my trusty calipers. From there, I created a design in Fusion 360. I
              added an offset of 0.5 mm to all the measurements so that the phone and the stand will fit. Then, I
              printed it in PLA. Super happy with the final result, and it slots into the keyboard very well. I put the
              phone into the stand upside down to access the volume buttons, and downloaded an app that allows my phone
              to rotate upside down (thanks Android). A nice project!
