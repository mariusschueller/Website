                    <p class="card__text">I took a VR class and for my group's project, we made a game called Fall Brawl. In the game, players can take pieces from the platform and throw them at their opponent to bump them off, and platform pieces fall after being stood on for 5 seconds. You can also move left, right, forward, and barward with the joystick.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card__text">In the project, I definitely did a lot of work. I implemented the networking for multiplayer, player movement, grabbing blocks, ground scripts so ground pieces fall after a certain amount of time, environment design, and all the menus outside of the gameplay. It was a ton of fun seeing people play the game in the final showcase.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card__text">I gained experience in 2 areas that I’ve wanted to learn about for a while in this project: VR and networking. I’ve tried to learn both of these in the past, but didn’t get too far. Vanderbilt offering this class was a great way for me to learn these concepts. If you want to play this game, you will need a Meta Quest headset, then you can download the apk in the repository, and then google how to install an apk onto a Meta Quest.
