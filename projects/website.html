          <h2>Portfolio Website</h2>
          
          <p class="description">A porfolio website made with purely HTML and CSS, and no Javascript.
            This website is intended to show my projects and be a place for me to write a blog. 
            The website was primarily designed over the course of 48 hours, but the plan is to keep it updated as more blog posts and projects are created.
