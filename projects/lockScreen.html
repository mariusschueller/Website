                    <p class="card__text">I wanted to make a lock screen background that showcased my interests.
                        Over the course of a day, I designed this background. 
                        The parts that I showcased were (from bottom to top) are music waves, bass clef, cello, piano, soccer, ballet, and then programming with one of the characters I designed.
                        It isn't perfect, the background color for most of the image is a dark blue while the top right and bottom of the image have black backgrounds which doesn't line up. 
                        That being said, I really like this design and still have it as my lock screen many years later.
