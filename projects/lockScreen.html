            <p class="card__text">I wanted to make a lock screen background that showcased my interests.
              Over the course of a day, I designed this background.
              The parts that I showcased were (from bottom to top) are music waves, bass clef, cello, piano, soccer,
              ballet, and then programming with one of the characters I designed.
              It isn't perfect, the background color for most of the image is a dark blue while the top right and bottom
              of the image have black backgrounds which doesn't line up.
              That being said, I really like this design and still have it as my lock screen many years later.
