                    <p class="card__text">I took a Rust class and made a command line tool for my final project called Projexts. I find changing directories in the command line or through folders to be pretty annoying, so I made a solution. Projexts is a simple and efficient command line tool designed to help users easily manage shortcuts for running their frequently used programs and scripts. By allowing users to add, remove, and list shortcuts associated with specific commands, this tool enhances productivity and reduces the time spent navigating complex command-line inputs. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="card__text">I looked up how to create a command line tool and followed the instructions. I was worried a lot about having enough lines of code for my professor, so I kept adding features like git push and open folder. It stores the files in a json file that gets created and edited whenever you add, remove, and edit projects. This did lead to an issue when testing because rust tests utilize multithreading, but a simple command change (in the readme) fixes this issue.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card__text">I find this tool to be pretty useful. I use it on my linux computer to open sh programs like Matlab and Superslicer. I use Matlab just enough where itâ€™s common that I always forget where the file is, so to just have it saved and easily accessible is great. To use Projexts, simply follow the instructions in the github repository.
